The other options focus on comparisons with the Wright Brothers or cooperation, which are not mentioned in the image description. Therefore, the image description can help narrow down the answer to option C."

While the image does not directly answer the question, it supports options related to the Wright Brothers and the first flight, making options A and C more likely. The description does not mention Whitehead or cooperation between inventors, making options B and D less relevant."
